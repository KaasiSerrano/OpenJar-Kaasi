# Features
---

1. Designs are **3D Printable** and **parametric**.

2. The designs print **without any supports**, and with any low-cost 3D printer.

3. Using ABS, your parts can be **dishwasher-safe** and can be made **watertight** with an acetone vapor treatment.

4. The thread fits any standard, low cost mason jars

5. Files are available in STL, STEP, and SOLIDWORKS

## Adapter Threads

These parts have two pieces.  The adapter lid and the thread component.   Threee options are pre-made.

The first adapter thread is for a common spray bottle such as windex.  Use the **lid_adapt.stl** and **thread_spray.stl**
![windex spray assembly](https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/5d5ee6d4e2c91ff5ddf7f72ecf03dda1/large.jpg)

The next thread is the foamy (my favorite).  It uses a larger adapter and a larger thread. Use **Lid_foamy.stl** and **thread_foamy.stl** and this is suited for one of the foaming soap pumps from dollar tree.

## Rubber Seal

You can store foods if you use a rubber seal. (actually, it's silicone)  I used [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TY28LZV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
