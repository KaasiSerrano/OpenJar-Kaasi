This project focuses on improving open-source hardware!
```

There are many 3D printable options online, but this project emphasizes open-source hardware.  I hope open hardware becomes like open source software: users can make modifications easily and contribute easily.

Therefore, we should make parametric models and finer documentation.  If documentation successfully explains the model and assembly, then we gain all of the benefits of open software. Lastly, we must make our designs fully digital. If I don't offer the CAD model of the store-bought jar, then contributors must reworkd the assembly ► this breaks the open-source ecosystem. Let's empower hardware designers! 

Cheers to hardware developers reaching a new paradigm. ☺

## Adapter Threads <br>


>Adapter threads have two pieces: adapter lid and the thread component.  Three options for threads are pre-made (with STL files).  Using two parts gives us no-support printing and modularity.  Easily bond the parts with superglue.


The first adapter thread is for a common spray bottle such as windex.  Use the **lid_adapt.stl** and **thread_spray.stl**

The next thread is the foamy (my favorite).  It uses a larger adapter and a larger thread. Use **Lid_foamy.stl** and **thread_foamy.stl** and this is suited for one of the foaming soap pumps from dollar tree.

## Rubber Seal <br>

You can store foods if you use a rubber seal. (actually, it's silicone)  I used [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TY28LZV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Jar Sizes


Any brand of jar will work, but the mouth size should be standard.

## Spray Nozzle


The spray nozzle setup is a two-part design.  To get the dip tube at the bottom of your jar, thread on the first piece and then cut the remaining length to 130mm.
