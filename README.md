There are many 3D printable jar lids online, but this project emphasizes open-source hardware.  I think that open hardware should become more like open source software: users can make modifications easily and contribute easily. That means, we should make our models parametric, and make finer documentation.  If the documentation successfully explains the model and the assembly, then we gain all of the benefits that open software gives and we can change the world.  Lastly, we must make our designs fully digital.  If I don't offer the CAD model of the store-bought jar, then contributors must reworkd the assembly, breaking the open-source ecosystem. I have high hopes that hardware developers can reach a new paradigm.

Keep these in mind:
| Modularity | Parametric models | Documentation | Digital Designs | 

## Adapter Threads <br>

```
These parts have two pieces.  The adapter lid and the thread component.   Three options for threads are pre-made.
```

The first adapter thread is for a common spray bottle such as windex.  Use the **lid_adapt.stl** and **thread_spray.stl**

The next thread is the foamy (my favorite).  It uses a larger adapter and a larger thread. Use **Lid_foamy.stl** and **thread_foamy.stl** and this is suited for one of the foaming soap pumps from dollar tree.

## Rubber Seal <br>

You can store foods if you use a rubber seal. (actually, it's silicone)  I used [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TY28LZV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Jars

```
Any brand of jar will work, but the mouth size should be standard.
```
