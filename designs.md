> The first upload was a threaded cap for Mason Jars but this cap is a similar component intended for bottle cap designs.
> Just like the Jar-cap, the bottle-cap has:
> * Threads
> * Sealing
> * Grip
> * Revolved body
>
> But, the range of design needs for a bottle is a bit different than a jar so this model has bottle-goals integrated into design intent.
